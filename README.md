<!-- # Payment Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project implements a simple payment dashboard using React and TypeScript. The dashboard showcases features of a hypothetical payment platform, including transactions, collections, and transfers.

### Features:

This project utilizes the following libraries to provide a robust and user-friendly experience:

React- (https://legacy.reactjs.org/): For building dynamic and interactive UI components.

TypeScript- (https://www.typescriptlang.org/): A statically typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and maintainability by adding strong typing, interfaces, and advanced tooling.

React Router- (https://reacttraining.com/react-router): For handling navigation between different views in the application and routes protection.

React Toastify- (https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/): For displaying user notifications.

React Icons- (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): For incorporating various icons within the UI.

Tailwind CSS- (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation): For rapid and responsive web UI development.

JSON-SERVER- The project stores data locally in JSON files where you can post and fetch the required data.

### Development Setup:

Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/GabrielOchieng/payment-dashboard.git.

Install dependencies: Run npm install in the project directory to install all required dependencies.

Development Server: Run npm run dev to start the development environment. This will launch the application in your browser for live updates as you make code changes.

JSON Server: Run json-server --watch transfers.json to access the JSON server on your local repository.

Build for Production: Run npm run build to create an optimized production build of the frontend code.

Linting: Run npm run lint to check your code for potential errors and style inconsistencies. -->

- **Tailwind CSS** ([tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)): Facilitates rapid and responsive web UI development.
- **JSON Server**: Stores and serves data locally using JSON files. Enables simple data operations like POST and FETCH.

### Development Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GabrielOchieng/payment-dashboard.git
   cd payment-dashboard
   Install Dependencies:
   ```

npm install

Start the Development Server:

npm run dev
This command launches the application and opens it in your browser, enabling live updates as you modify the code.

Run JSON Server:

json-server --watch transfers.json
This starts the JSON server to handle local data fetching and posting. Ensure transfers.json is present in the root directory of your project.

Build for Production:

npm run build
Generates an optimized production build of the frontend code.

Lint the Code:

npm run lint
